   \item{condition}{test condition (control, nullified, stereotype threat)}
   \item{sex}{the individual's sex (male, female)}
   \item{y}{score on the arithmetic test, out of 40}

\description{
An artificial dataset created by Lix et al. from summary data presented by Wicherts et al. (2005)
(see the vignette). These authors examined the effects of stereotype threat on women's mathematics ability. 
Originally there were four different tests administered to study participants (arithmetic,
number series, word problems, and sums tests). The dataset contains only scores for the arithmetic test
because these scores exhibited a greater magnitude of variance heterogeneity than scores for
the other tests. It is an unbalanced design with cell sizes ranging from 45 to 50 participants, and a total
sample size of 283.
