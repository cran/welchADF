\description{
An artificial dataset created by Lix et al. which recreates data reported by a real study
on perception and concentration, on which 42 students were given several puzzles to be solved. 
The students are divided into three balanced groups as they had previously been asked to 
imagine solving puzzles in the distant future, near future, or not to imagine anything at all 
(control group).
